/*
 * Mockito is a powerful mocking framework for Java applications. 
 * It allows you to create mock objects, define their behavior, and 
 * verify interactions. To mock dependencies in your unit tests, use 
 * Mockito’s @Mock annotation and @InjectMocks annotation to inject the 
 * mocks into the class under test.
 * 
 * Why Mock?
 * 
 * Why should we use a mock instead of a real service object in a test?
 * Imagine the service implementation above has a dependency to a database or 
 * some other third-party system. We don’t want to have our test run against the 
 * database. If the database isn’t available, the test will fail even though our 
 * system under test might be completely bug-free. The more dependencies we add in 
 * a test, the more reasons a test has to fail. And most of those reasons will be 
 * the wrong ones. If we use a mock instead, we can mock all those potential 
 * failures away.
 * 
 * Aside from reducing failures, mocking also reduces our tests' complexity and 
 * thus saves us some effort. It takes a lot of boilerplate code to set up a 
 * whole network of correctly-initialized objects to be used in a test. 
 * Using mocks, we only have to “instantiate” one mock instead of a whole 
 * rat-tail of objects the real object might need to be instantiated.
 * 
 * In summary, we want to move from a potentially complex, slow, and 
 * flaky integration test towards a simple, fast, and reliable unit test.
 * 
 * As a mocking framework, we’ll use Mockito, since it’s well-rounded, 
 * well-established, and well-integrated into Spring Boot.
 * 
 * Mockito provides some handy annotations that reduce the manual work 
 * of creating mock instances and passing them into the object we’re about to test.
 * 
 * With JUnit Jupiter, we need to apply the MockitoExtension to our test:
 * 
 * We can then use the @Mock and @InjectMocks annotations on fields of the test.
 * 
 * Fields annotated with @Mock will then automatically be initialized with a 
 * mock instance of their type, just like as we would call Mockito.mock() by hand.
 * 
 * Mockito will then try to instantiate fields annotated with @InjectMocks by 
 * passing all mocks into a constructor. Note that we need to provide such a 
 * constructor for Mockito to work reliably. If Mockito doesn’t find a constructor, 
 * it will try setter injection or field injection, but the cleanest way is still 
 * a constructor. You can read about the algorithm behind this in Mockito’s Javadoc.
 *
